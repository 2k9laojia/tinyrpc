tinyrpc
=======

tinyrpc is a simple RPC library built on top of MPI

Well, of course you can replace the communication with a socket library or other communication library

Current implementation uses C++11 threads and locks, so you need a new compiler to compile the code.

Tested on visual studio 2012.
